# World Holiday Check

If you need something to celebrate today, search the world's calendar to find a reason to celebrate!

Any user can discover the dates of an official holiday for any country, or subdivision, included in the list of ISO 3166 country codes for any date between 1900-2049.

The user can search a specific country code for a full year of holidays, a specific month within a year, or a specific date that includes the day.  They might even wish to know all of the holidays on a given day in every month: this too is allowed!

The only user requirements are including a Country and the Year in question.

## Instructions

To use:
1. Select a Country.
2. Use the "Use Today!" button to populate the day in question.
3. Input a Year.  The current year is automatically populated.
4. Optionally select a Month to clarify the search.
5. Optionally select a Day to clarify the search.
6. Submit the form with an "Enter" keypress or the "Get Holidays" button.
